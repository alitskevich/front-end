# 2. Basic Shell Programming.


# 2.1. Variables.


varname=value                # defines a variable
varname=value command        # defines a variable to be in the environment of a particular subprocess
echo $varname                # checks a variable's value
echo $$                      # prints process ID of the current shell
echo $!                      # prints process ID of the most recently invoked background job
echo $?                      # displays the exit status of the last command
export VARNAME=value         # defines an environment variable (will be available in subprocesses)

array[0] = val               # several ways to define an array
array[1] = val
array[2] = val
array=([2]=val [0]=val [1]=val)
array(val val val)

${array[i]}                  # displays array's value for this index. If no index is supplied, array element 0 is assumed
${#array[i]}                 # to find out the length of any element in the array
${#array[@]}                 # to find out how many values there are in the array

declare -a                   # the variables are treaded as arrays
declare -f                   # uses funtion names only
declare -F                   # displays function names without definitions
declare -i                   # the variables are treaded as integers
declare -r                   # makes the variables read-only
declare -x                   # marks the variables for export via the environment

${varname:-word}             # if varname exists and isn't null, return its value; otherwise return word
${varname:=word}             # if varname exists and isn't null, return its value; otherwise set it word and then return its value
${varname:?message}          # if varname exists and isn't null, return its value; otherwise print varname, followed by message and abort the current command or script
${varname:+word}             # if varname exists and isn't null, return word; otherwise return null
${varname:offset:length}     # performs substring expansion. It returns the substring of $varname starting at offset and up to length characters

${variable#pattern}          # if the pattern matches the beginning of the variable's value, delete the shortest part that matches and return the rest
${variable##pattern}         # if the pattern matches the beginning of the variable's value, delete the longest part that matches and return the rest
${variable%pattern}          # if the pattern matches the end of the variable's value, delete the shortest part that matches and return the rest
${variable%%pattern}         # if the pattern matches the end of the variable's value, delete the longest part that matches and return the rest
${variable/pattern/string}   # the longest match to pattern in variable is replaced by string. Only the first match is replaced
${variable//pattern/string}  # the longest match to pattern in variable is replaced by string. All matches are replaced

${#varname}                  # returns the length of the value of the variable as a character string

*(patternlist)               # matches zero or more occurences of the given patterns
+(patternlist)               # matches one or more occurences of the given patterns
?(patternlist)               # matches zero or one occurence of the given patterns
@(patternlist)               # matches exactly one of the given patterns
!(patternlist)               # matches anything except one of the given patterns

$(UNIX command)              # command substitution: runs the command and returns standard output


# 2.2. Functions.
# The function refers to passed arguments by position (as if they were positional parameters), that is, $1, $2, and so forth.
# $@ is equal to "$1" "$2"... "$N", where N is the number of positional parameters. $# holds the number of positional parameters.
