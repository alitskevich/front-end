# 5. Process Handling.

# To suspend a job, type CTRL+Z while it is running. You can also suspend a job with CTRL+Y.
# This is slightly different from CTRL+Z in that the process is only stopped when it attempts to read input from terminal.
# Of course, to interupt a job, type CTRL+C.

myCommand &  # runs job in the background and prompts back the shell

jobs         # lists all jobs (use with -l to see associated PID)

fg           # brings a background job into the foreground
fg %+        # brings most recently invoked background job
fg %-        # brings second most recently invoked background job
fg %N        # brings job number N
fg %string   # brings job whose command begins with string
fg %?string  # brings job whose command contains string

kill -l      # returns a list of all signals on the system, by name and number
kill PID     # terminates process with specified PID

ps           # prints a line of information about the current running login shell and any processes running under it
ps -a        # selects all processes with a tty except session leaders

trap cmd sig1 sig2  # executes a command when a signal is received by the script
trap "" sig1 sig2   # ignores that signals
trap - sig1 sig2    # resets the action taken when the signal is received to the default

disown <PID|JID>    # removes the process from the list of jobs

wait                # waits until all background jobs have finished

# 6. Tips and Tricks.

# set an alias
cd; nano .bash_profile
> alias gentlenode='ssh admin@gentlenode.com -p 3404'  # add your alias in .bash_profile

# to quickly go to a specific directory
cd; nano .bashrc
> shopt -s cdable_vars
> export websites="/Users/mac/Documents/websites"

source .bashrc
cd websites

# 7. Debugging Shell Programs.

bash -n scriptname  # don't run commands; check for syntax errors only
set -o noexec       # alternative (set option in script)

bash -v scriptname  # echo commands before running them
set -o verbose      # alternative (set option in script)

bash -x scriptname  # echo commands after command-line processing
set -o xtrace       # alternative (set option in script)

trap 'echo $varname' EXIT  # useful when you want to print out the values of variables at the point that your script exits

function errtrap {
  es=$?
  echo "ERROR line $1: Command exited with status $es."
}

trap 'errtrap $LINENO' ERR  # is run whenever a command in the surrounding script or function exists with non-zero status 

function dbgtrap {
  echo "badvar is $badvar"
}

trap dbgtrap DEBUG  # causes the trap code to be executed before every statement in a function or script
# ...section of code in which the problem occurs...
trap - DEBUG  # turn off the DEBUG trap

function returntrap {
  echo "A return occured"
}

trap returntrap RETURN  # is executed each time a shell function or a script executed with the . or source commands finishes executing
